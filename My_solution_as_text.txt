# maze solutions:
(52, 903, 1763)

#Dijkstra Algorithm
#time complexity: O((R x C) log (R x C))
Insertion into priority queue is O(log N) where N is the number of elements in priority queue
Extracting element from priority queue is O(log N)
Traversing the grid: number of cells in maze is R x C where R is number of rows  and C is for columns
Since each cell is pushed and popped into priority queue, complexity becomes O((R x C) log(R x C))


#space complexity: O( R x C)
